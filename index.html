                            My set of knowledge and abilites create a spectrum that ranges from interaction, interface, 
                            &    concept design over management techniques to technical implementation.
                            For coding I have so far used JS, HTML, CSS and am willing to learn new languages 
                            and frameworks. <br>
                            Even though I so far had to focus on coding I am also very active when it comes to developing 
                            concepts and designing the interaction between the user and other entities. 
                            My specialisation in the intersection of those realms is what makes me 
                            valuable when working with and creating novel media.
                            I like to structure things and with good logical thinking I see my role 
                            in the team as someone who can integrate methodology in the creative 
                            workflow and can moderate discussions team-internally and with stakeholdes.

                        A Starting Point 
                    </span>
                    In our introductory semester of my undergraduate program we were 
                    started with learning about what design is and came in touch with 
                    it visually. <em>Interactive Media Design</em> is a project based program, 
                    though the first semester was one of smaller scale. The given topic 
                    for this semester was to design a food truck service. 
                    My group created a tourist attraction that made it possible for 
                    tourists to experience the city both in a way of sightseeing
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-website-styleguide.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Project Website">
                    and also in a way that allowed them to taste culinaric soul of the 
                    city. 
                    Out of that service we should then fashion a website and a 
                    prototpe for an interface our guests inside the truck. Because we 
                    distributed the work so that I was responsible for the creation 
                    of the website in HTML and CSS I will be focusing on this part of the project.
                    If I had to choose now, my interest in developing the interface would be a lot 
                    greater than creating another website.
                </p>

                        Designing the Website 
                    </span>
                    The website was designed to emphasize the feeling of being in 
                    a big city. 
                    Those tend to cause too much stimuli rushing through people
                    so we tried to combine said feeling with a rather clean look so that
                    the user can concentrate on the interface's features.
                    To accentuate our service in this interface we built a horizontal 
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-screenshot-styleguide.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Project Styleguide">
                    scroll for the navigation. While manual scrolling was disabled you 
                    could click on the navigation points to let the website smoothly 
                    scroll to desired section of the website. 
                    This was more of a symbolic decision to enhance the user experience
                    when navigating: 
                    Scrolling alongside the skyline to get from one point of the website 
                    to another one is to imitate the same movement through the 
                    city that the user would enjoy when they are taking the ride 
                    we provide as our service.

                        Giving It A Look
                    </span>
                    The colors we used are incredibly bright and striking which 
                    was thought to transfer the feeling of excitement. 
                    While I still find these colors to be effective in that matter, 
                    I also think that for others it might rather seem like 
                    aggressive advertisement than a welcoming interface.

                        Changes Please
                    </span>
                    There are quite a lot of things that I'd like to change.
                    Looking at it now, a makeover of the spacing properties between elements 
                    like the logo and the canvas borders would be adeuqate.    
                    Also I would definitely redesign the navigation 
                    bar since it blocks the upward rising flow from the buildings. 
                    A better way to sovle this issue would be by assimilating it 
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-website-team.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Project Team Site">
                    to the background by giving it a vertical order.
                    The same blocking behavior also appears through the gradient effect at the 
                    very top of the site from black downwards to transparent.
                    Though it is pretty subtle it is still contrahery to the flow of the buildings.
                    But there are also smaller things like the  sharp contrast between 
                    the cirular cropped profile pictures and the profile description blocks 
                    with its unnessecary italics.

                    </span>
                    <!-- early OOP -->
                    For our subject <em>Creative Coding</em> I developed a game. The available 
                    options were classics like Pong, Snake or a self-designed game. My professor
                    advised that self-designed games suited students more advanced so I was keen 
                    on giving it a try. Based on the animated TV-show <em>Rick and Morty</em> I
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-game-level01.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Game">
                    created a browser bassed platforming game starring the show's two main characters with common and 
                    unique abilities. I also added items and enemies. You can check out and play 
                    the result <a href="https://nicholaskonrad.github.io/IMD1_Game/index.html" target="blank">here</a>.
                    While we only covered the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (variables, if-statements, loops and arrays)  
                    I digged into object orientated programming 
                    and designed my code accordingly. I therefore learned approximately half of the second semester 
                    of coding within the first one. Since it's caused good resonance from both common students
                    and my professor I was keen on diving into coding.

                    was the topic for our second semester. Based on that we should develop a 
                    simulation. We decided to make a piece of media that shows users how their 
                    actions influences their environment. Since climate changes is a hot topic
                    we saw great relevance in it. We used the opportunity of experimental design 
                    <img src="./assets/semester02-simulation.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of my second Semester simulation">
                    to take a gamificated approach. With the right combination of storytelling
                    and gamification we created a story of a traveling family. The user
                    can take various actions that cause different outcomes at the end of the 
                    simulation. We very subtly tried to bring in options of littering so that  
                    Once the simulation was played through the user saw a fast-forward to a few 
                    years later when the family came to the same travel destination where the 
                    environmental changes had become visible. We then showed tips on how to improve
                    the users decision-making in terms of environmental awareness.

                        Machine Learning
                    </span>
                    A former student from the <em>MIT</em> came to our campus to teach us how to
                    <em>create rich user experiences with applied machine learning</em>. While I've 
                    had red about the principles of neural networks before I had never before been 
                    in touch with the actual developement of a working model. Unfortunately our 
                    <img src="./assets/semester02"
                    alt="Screenshot of my first machine learning result">
                    professor could not supervise our projects that much when we were in the hands-on 
                    phase of this course. 
                    By reading articles and following tutorials I finally was able to
                    create a neural network that allowed you to capture footage through your webcam
                    and then transfer it into a specific artstyle in a live manner.
                    This was also the first time I came in touch with Python and libraries which
                    made it surprisingly hard for me to archieve my goals. Even though it was a 
                    tough way to the finish line I am still interested in learning more about 
                    artificial intelligence.

                        Introduction To Filmmaking
                    </span>
                    To present our projects in a more fascinating way we also approached video
                    creation so we produced a trailer that should explain the relevance of the 
                    topic we were dealinng with and our solution for the problem. For this to
                    work we were in contact with a professor from the <em>Motion Pictures</em> 
                    Program.

                    Unfortunately it did not turn out as well as we planned because we had to 
                    shoot our footage somewhere similiar to a beach The best location we could 
                    find was not very convincing and made it hard for us to get the right lightfont
                    conditions. Additionally, we were filming with a child which made it even harder 
                    to get the wanted result. While I was very unhappy with the final outcome due to 
                    those reasons, the concept for our trailer received approval.
