                        <p>     
                            My set of knowledge and abilities create a spectrum that ranges from interaction, interface, 
                            &    concept design over management techniques to technical implementation.
                            For coding I have so far used JS, HTML, CSS and am willing to learn new languages 
                            and frameworks. <br>
                            Even though I so far had to focus on coding I am also very active when it comes to developing 
                            concepts and designing the interaction between the user and other entities as well as
                            the look & feel of the interfaces. 
                            My specialisation in the intersection of those realms is what makes me 
                            valuable when working with and creating novel media.
                            I like to structure things and with good logical thinking I see my role 
                            in the team as someone who can integrate methodology in the creative 
                            workflow and can moderate discussions team-internally and with stakeholders.

                        <p>
                            What I like most about the industry that I will be in is the mixture of 
                            creative and technical work. This is the very thing that I will try to keep
                            when I leave university. I need variety. Change. Diversity.
                            Ideally I am going to be active in a field and position that allows temporary
                            switches between multiple realms of activity.
                            Specifically, I am curious to create smart environments with design of 
                            ubiquitous computing. Collaboration with architects or psychologists is a 
                            safe bait for me.
                            Apart from that I want to work in an environment that allows me to learn and
                            grow both personally and academically in terms of pure knowledge, soft skills, etc.
                            If you can offer any of those aspects, then that is very likely to be the reason 
                            that I send you this portfolio. Enjoy skipping through it!

                        A Starting Point 
                    </span>
                    In our introductory semester of my undergraduate program we 
                    started with learning about what design is and came in touch with 
                    it visually. <a href="https://imd.mediencampus.h-da.de/"><em>Interactive Media Design</em></a> is a project based program, 
                    though the first semester was one of smaller scale. The given topic 
                    for this semester was to design a food truck service. 
                    My group created a tourist attraction that made it possible for 
                    tourists to experience the city both in a way of sightseeing
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-website-styleguide.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Project Website">
                    and also in a way that allowed them to taste culinary soul of the 
                    city. 
                    Out of that service we should then fashion a website and a 
                    prototype for an interface our guests would use inside the truck. 
                    We played around with color palettes, tried different layouts and
                    interaction methods until we agreed on the final outcome that we 
                    then implemented. For that part I was responsible for the website.
                    Since then, I often had to deal with more frontend development but 
                    my interest has strongly shifted to more logic-orientated work 
                    such as server-side programming.

                        Game Programming
                    </span>
                    For our subject <em>Creative Coding</em> I developed a game. The available 
                    options were classics like Pong, Snake or a self-designed game. My professor
                    advised that self-designed games suited students more advanced so I was keen 
                    on giving it a try. Based on the animated TV-show <em>Rick and Morty</em> I
                    created a browser based platforming game starring the show's two main characters with common and 
                    unique abilities. I also added items and enemies. You can check out and play

                    While we only covered the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript (variables, if-statements, loops and arrays)  
                    I digged into object orientated programming 
                    and designed my code accordingly. I therefore learned approximately half of the second semester 
                    of coding within the first one. Since it's caused good resonance from both common students
                    and my professor I was keen on diving into coding during the following semesters.

                        Experimental Design 
                    </span>
                    was the topic for our second semester. Based on that we should develop a 
                    simulation. Since climate changes is a hot topic
                    we decided to make a piece of media that shows users how their 
                    actions influences their environment. We used the opportunity of experimental design 
                    to take a gamificated approach. With the right combination of storytelling
                    and gamification we created a story of a traveling family. The user
                    <img src="./assets/semester02-simulation.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of my second Semester simulation">
                    can take various actions that cause different outcomes at the end of the 
                    simulation. We thought about where and how this project would be used to raise
                    further environmental awareness. Additionally, in this semester we were busy
                    planning an exhibition called <em>interactive future [if]</em> where we were to 
                    present our projects, invite speakers and have meet and greets with various companies.

                        Machine Learning
                    </span>
                    An external professor came to our campus to teach how to
                    <em>create rich user experiences with applied machine learning</em> 
                    in an optional course. While I've 
                    had read about the principles of neural networks before I have not been 
                    in touch with the actual developement of a working model. Unfortunately our 
                    professor could not supervise our projects that much when we were in the hands-on 
                    phase of this course. 
                    By reading articles and following tutorials I finally was able to
                    <img src="./assets/semester02-machinelearning.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of my first machine learning result">
                    create a neural network that allowed you to capture footage through your webcam
                    and then transfer it into a specific art style in a live manner.
                    This was also the first time I came in touch with Python and libraries which
                    made it surprisingly hard for me to achieve my goals. Even though it was a 
                    tough way to the finish line and there are a few aspects about this project 
                    that could be optimized I am still <strong>very</strong> interested 
                    in learning more about artificial intelligence.

                    </span>
                    The third semester was so far the most important one in my academic career. 
                    It taught me not to depend on subjective perceptions when making decisions in 
                    the design process. I was writing a research paper on whether automotive cars and 
                    e-cars will turn traffic to the better as an introduction to scientific design.
                    The semester project was about preventing roadkills. We tried a lot of different 
                    methodical approaches to gain objective, fact-based insights to solve the problem.

                    alt="Photo of my third semester methodical work">
                    We were researching a lot, created profiles of different types of drivers, 
                    had interviews and even contacted the police to have a face-to-face conversation
                    in order to gather more data that could help us. 
                    In the end we created a project that we saw great chance in for the automotive
                    industry to adopt and actually implement it.
                    I really liked this semester because we followed the inductive top-down workflow
                    to achieve the solution to the problem, which included a variety of sensory feedback
                    channels.

                    For our prototype I used an Arduino with an ultrasonic sensor and a slider potentiometer
                    that would allow the user to control the speed of a self-made driving simulation. 
                    This simulation showed how our developed system would notify the driver when a wild animal
                    was spotted and how it would react when the driver did not respond accordingly to those
                    warnings. For this setup of to work I needed server-side programming, which we were introduced
                    to with NodeJs in this third semester.

                        Reply Creative Challenge 
                    </span>
                    With three colleagues out of my semester we signed up for a challenge that would let
                    you choose a category for a 2.5-day project to create a campaign for different companies,
                    depending on the category. We went with <em>Durex'</em> aim to get millenials and generation Z

                    to talk about their sexuality more openly.
                    We took an approach that included illustration to convey diversity and humor in given context.
                    Though we were not among the selection of the best campaigns after the challenge ended,
                    we saw that Durex posted advertising campaigns on Instagram that were very similar to what
                    we created.

                        ThingsCon Hack Challenge   
                    </span>
                    The <em>ThingsCon</em> in Rotterdam is, as one can tell by the name, about the 
                    internet of things and smart connected devices in general.
                    The so called <em>Hack Challenge</em> also offered different problems that participants
                    were to develop a concept for a solution. In our case we picked a ventilation problems
                    <img src="./assets/challenges-thingsCon.png"
                    alt="ThingsCon logo">
                    that the architecture of the building (a repurposed public pool) caused. We proposed 
                    that with help of different sensors and the installation of panels on the windows 
                    we could control the airflow in dependency on temperature, air humidity, 
                    wind direction and strength. This solution would also allow us to create airflow
                    when there was none.

                        COVID Hackathon
                    </span>
                    After the Corona virus breakout our university had to switch to remote classes.
                    While working from home does come with its benefits, we did not like not seeing
                    each other in person. We could relate to those that were locked up in isolation
                    with depression and could not have any or just the bare minimum of social contact.
                    So we participated in the official hackathon of the German 
                    government.

                    alt="Corona hackathon of the german government">
                    The 2.5-days project turned into a concept that would connect neighbours and let them 
                    communicate with each other asynchronously in a gamificated way.
                    With that we were trying to achieve that the people in neighbourhoods could start
                    to support and take care of each other more.
