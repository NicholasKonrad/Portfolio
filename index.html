                            <p style="margin-bottom: 8vh;">     
                                My set of knowledge and abilities create a spectrum that ranges from interaction, interface, 
                                &    concept design over management techniques to technical implementation.
                                For coding I have so far used JS, HTML, CSS and am willing to learn new languages 
                                and frameworks. <br>
                                Even though I so far had to focus on coding I am also very active when it comes to developing 
                                concepts and designing the interaction between the user and other entities as well as
                                the look & feel of the interfaces. 
                                My specialisation in the intersection of those areas is what makes me 
                                valuable when working with and creating novel media.
                                I like to structure things and with good logical thinking I see my role 
                                in the team as someone who can integrate methodology in the creative 
                                workflow and can moderate discussions team-internally and with stakeholders.

                            <p>
                                What I like most about the industry that I will be in is the mixture of 
                                creative and technical work. This is the very thing that I will try to keep
                                when I leave university. I need variety. Change. Diversity.
                                Ideally I am going to be active in a field and position that allows temporary
                                switches between multiple realms of activity.
                                Specifically, I am curious to create smart environments with design of 
                                ubiquitous computing. Collaboration with architects or psychologists is a 
                                safe bait for me.
                                Apart from that I want to work in an environment that allows me to learn and
                                grow both personally and academically in terms of pure knowledge, soft skills, etc.
                                If you can offer any of those aspects, then that is very likely to be the reason 
                                why I send you this portfolio. Enjoy skipping through it!

                        A Starting Point 
                    </span>
                    In our introductory semester of my undergraduate program we 
                    started with learning about what design is and came in touch with 
                    it visually. 
                    <a target="blank" href="https://imd.mediencampus.h-da.de/">Interactive Media Design</a> 
                    is a project based program, 
                    though the first semester was one of smaller scale. The given topic 
                    for this semester was to design a food truck service. 
                    Out of that service we should then fashion a website and a 
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-website-styleguide.png" 
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Project Website">
                    prototype for an interface our guests would use inside the truck. 
                    We played around with color palettes, tried different layouts and
                    interaction methods until we agreed on the final outcome that we 
                    then implemented.

                        Game Programming
                    </span>
                    For our subject <em>Creative Coding</em> I developed a game. Based on the animated TV-show <em>Rick and Morty</em> I
                    created a browser based platforming game starring the show's two main characters with common and 
                    unique abilities, items and enemies. You can check out and play 
                    the result <a href="https://nicholaskonrad.github.io/IMD1_Game/index.html" target="blank">here</a>.
                    Even though I retrospectively find the lack of UX comfortability troubling I recieved quite a lot of 
                    <img src="./assets/semester01-game-level01.png"
                    alt="Screenshot of my first Semester Game">
                    very good feedback from both professors and students for the features I build. 
                    This was largely achieved by teaching myself object oriented programming, which
                    was planned to be the content of the second semester of coding class.

                    With the right combination of storytelling
                    and gamification we created a story of a traveling family where the user
                    can take various actions that cause different outcomes at the end of the 
                    simulation. It's purpose was to show the user how little mondane (partly subconscious) 
                    decisions affected their environment in the long run.

                    alt="Screenshot of my second Semester simulation">
                    We thought about where and how this project would be used to raise
                    further environmental awareness. Additionally, in this semester we were busy
                    planning an exhibition called <em>interactive future [if]</em> where we were to 
                    present our projects, invite speakers and have meet and greets with various companies.

                    While I've 
                    had read about the principles of neural networks before I have not been 
                    in touch with the actual developement of a working model. 
                    This optional course was very tough for me but by reading articles and 
                    following tutorials I finally was able to
                    create a neural network that allowed you to capture footage through your webcam

                    in a live manner.
                    This was also the first time I came in touch with Python and libraries which
                    made it surprisingly hard for me to achieve my goals. I am still 
                    <strong>very</strong> interested 
                    in learning more about artificial intelligence.

                    </span>
                    The third semester was so far the most important one in my academic career. 
                    It taught me not to depend on subjective perceptions when making decisions in 
                    the design process. I was writing a research paper as an introduction to scientific design. 
                    The semester project was about preventing roadkills. We tried a lot of different 
                    methodical approaches to gain objective, fact-based insights to solve the problem.

                    alt="Photo of my third semester methodical work - shown sketch was not the final concept">
                    We were researching a lot, created user profiles, 
                    had interviews and even contacted the police to have a face-to-face conversation
                    in order to gather more data that could help us. 
                    In the end we created a project that we saw great chance in for the automotive
                    industry to adopt and actually implement it.
                    I really liked this semester because we followed the inductive top-down workflow
                    to achieve the solution to the problem, which included a variety of sensory feedback
                    channels.

                    For our prototype I used an Arduino with an ultrasonic sensor and a slider potentiometer
                    that would allow the user to control the speed of a self-made driving simulation. 
                    This simulation showed how our developed system would notify the driver when a wild animal
                    was spotted and how it would react when the driver did not respond accordingly to those

                    warnings. For this setup to work I needed server-side programming, which we were introduced
                    to with NodeJs in this third semester. I also learned how to use packages by 
                    making use of a library called <a target="blank" href="http://johnny-five.io/">Johnny-Five</a> to use its
                    serial port to connect my computer to the Arduino.

                        Reply Creative Challenge 
                    </span>
                    With three colleagues out of my semester we signed up for a challenge that would let
                    you choose a category for a 2.5-day project to create a campaign for different companies,
                    depending on the category. We went with <em>Durex'</em> aim to get millenials and generation Z

                    to talk about their sexuality more openly.
                    We took an approach that included illustration to convey diversity and humor in given context.
                    Though we were not among the selection of the best campaigns after the challenge ended,
                    we saw that Durex posted advertising campaigns on Instagram that were very similar to what
                    we created.

                        ThingsCon Hack Challenge   
                    </span>
                    The <em>ThingsCon</em> in Rotterdam is, as one can tell by the name, about the 
                    internet of things and smart connected devices in general.
                    The so called <em>Hack Challenge</em> also offered different problems that participants
                    were to develop a concept for a solution. In our case we picked a ventilation problems

                    alt="ThingsCon logo">
                    that the architecture of the building (a repurposed public pool) caused. We proposed 
                    that with help of different sensors and the installation of panels on the windows 
                    we could control the airflow in dependency on temperature, air humidity, 
                    wind direction and strength. This solution would also allow us to create airflow
                    when there was none.

                        COVID Hackathon
                    </span>
                    After the Corona virus breakout our university had to switch to remote classes.
                    While working from home does come with its benefits, we did not like not seeing
                    each other in person. We could relate to those that were locked up in isolation
                    with depression and could not have any or just the bare minimum of social contact.
                    So we participated in the official hackathon of the German 
                    government.

                    The 2.5-days project turned into a concept that would connect neighbours and let them 
                    communicate with each other asynchronously in a gamificated way.
                    With that we were trying to achieve that the people in neighbourhoods could start
                    to support and take care of each other more.
